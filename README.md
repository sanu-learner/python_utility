# python_utility
This Repo will consists of many common utilities that could be used on a day-2-day basis for automating any common tasks.
All the utilities will be available under the common_utils package.

1.  The very first utility added is to rename all the subdirectories within a given directory to the lowercase.

   e.g if a dir "/test" contains 2 subdirectories "DIR1" and "DIR2", this python utility will rename it to the lowercase "dir1" and "dir2" respectively.
